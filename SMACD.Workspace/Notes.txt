*** NOTE: When using the term "triggered" in this document, it is referring to the addition 
          of the Action to the *end* of the Task queue

Actions:
- Can be triggered by the creation of an Artifact or the execution of an Action
- Are either Producers, Consumers, or Deciders

Producer Actions:
- Run tooling and produce artifacts

Consumer Actions:
- Ingest artifacts and create new artifacts and/or reports

Decider Actions:
- Ingest artifacts and trigger other Actions 
- Similar to Triggers, but used for more complex logic


Artifacts:
- Files/Directories/Objects stored as outputs from producers
- All stored in a single repository data file


Options:
- Modifications specified to adjust the behavior of an Action


Targets:
- Descriptions of items a Producer can act upon


Tasks:
- Association of Targets and Options to an Action
- These are used to queue actions on the Task queue


Workspaces:
- Base class for all Actions
- Provide framework features in the form of Toolboxes
- Provides ArtifactRoot to house artifacts generated by Action


Workspace Toolboxes:
- Singletons which provide framework features

ActionToolbox:
- Registers/Provides Actions from libraries
- Can provide either an ActionDescriptor or an instance of the Action itself (as the base 
  class "Workspace")

TargetToolbox:
- Registers/Provides Targets for Actions
- Can be added to by Consumers to provide additional "found" Targets to new Actions

TaskToolbox:
- Provides a Task queue for Actions
- Has a maximum number of parallelized Tasks to avoid choking tools
- Fires events when Tasks are begun and completed
