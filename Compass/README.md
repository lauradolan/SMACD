# Compass - Data Visualizer

## Building
To provide the best possible cross-platform experience, Compass is an Electron.NET application, powered by server-side Blazor, using Bootstrap components. **Note that this application uses the NET Core 3.0 SDK**

### Prerequisites
* nodeJS v8.6.0 (for Electron.NET)
* electron-builder package (if on Linux/macOS)
* NET Core SDK 3.0.100
* Visual Studio 2019 **Preview**
* [Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET) CLI Tools

Generally the project should already be in this state, but just to be sure, the first time you build the project, (in the project directory) run
```shellscript
$ electronize init
```

After that, running the project can be accomplished by running
```shellscript
$ electronize start
```

**In addition to running in Electron mode**, the application can be run in a normal IIS Express debug environment via Visual Studio, to improve the development experience.

## Usage
Compass allows for a complete exploration of all information collected from the various Extensions loaded during the Synthesys tool's scan. This includes:

* *Reports* - Specific to the Extension, a Report shows all available information that the Extension was able to find about the target
* *Artifacts* - Artifacts are generalized conclusions made by a combination of data points from each Extension. This is a set of common elements among many scanners which is used to make conclusions about future actions, if appropriate.
* *Evidence* - Verbose copies of reports generated by tools wrapped by Extensions. This is to review more information around a Vulnerability.
* *Vulnerabilities* - Vulnerabilities are records of issues which are described in a common way and are populated in the context of Artifacts by many Extensions
