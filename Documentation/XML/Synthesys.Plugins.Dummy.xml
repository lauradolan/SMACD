             This property provides an a more concrete implementation of ServicePortArtifact, which means if a Target is identified as an HTTP server, that Target will be referenced from both this property and the "Service" property below.

             This property will only be populated if the ActionExtension is queued with an open port (service) as a Target. If no compatible Targets were found, this will remain null.
            
             If a more concrete implementation is not matched (for example, because the service was not fingerprinted), the property with the closest parent Type will be referenced.
